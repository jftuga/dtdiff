```
Could you please give me a detailed explanation and decompose how exactly this line works?
```

Certainly! Let's break down how this line works:

```go
to = carbonFuncs[word].([2]interface{})[index].(func(carbon.Carbon, int) carbon.Carbon)(to, num)
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. `carbonFuncs[word]`: Accesses the value stored in the `carbonFuncs` map with the key `word`. In this map, the values are arrays containing two functions (`Add*` and `Sub*`) for different time periods (`word`).

2. `([2]interface{})[index]`: Retrieves the appropriate function from the array based on the `index`. `index` is either 0 or 1, representing whether we are adding or subtracting the time period.

3. `. (func(carbon.Carbon, int) carbon.Carbon)`: This is a type assertion. It asserts that the retrieved function is of type `func(carbon.Carbon, int) carbon.Carbon`, meaning it takes a `carbon.Carbon` type and an integer as arguments and returns a `carbon.Carbon` type.

4. `(to, num)`: Provides the arguments to the function. `to` is the `carbon.Carbon` object representing the starting time, and `num` is the amount of the time period to add or subtract.

5. `(to, num)` is the argument list being passed to the retrieved function, and it is executed immediately within the same line.

So, in summary, this line retrieves the appropriate function from the `carbonFuncs` map based on the time period (`word`) and whether we are adding or subtracting (`index`). Then it executes that function with the `to` time object and the `num` value as arguments, updating the `to` time object with the result.

Go into more detail for item 2 and item 3. Also explain what a type assertion is.
```

Certainly, let's delve deeper into items 2 and 3 and also explain what a type assertion is:

```go
to = carbonFuncs[word].([2]interface{})[index].(func(carbon.Carbon, int) carbon.Carbon)(to, num)
```

### Item 2: `[2]interface{}[index]`
This part is crucial for accessing the correct function from the array stored in the `carbonAdders` map. Let's break it down further:

- `[2]interface{}`: This indicates that the value stored in `carbonAdders[word]` is an array of length 2, where each element is of type `interface{}`. In Go, `interface{}` is a special type that can hold values of any type.

- `[index]`: The `[index]` part selects either the first or second function in the array. Since the array has a length of 2, `index` can only be either 0 or 1. It's a way to choose between the "add" and "subtract" functions.

### Item 3: `. (func(carbon.Carbon, int) carbon.Carbon)`
This part is a type assertion. Let's dissect it:

- `.`: The dot `.` operator in Go is used to access fields and methods of a struct or to perform type assertions.

- `(func(carbon.Carbon, int) carbon.Carbon)`: This is the target type to which we're asserting the retrieved value. It describes a function signature that takes a `carbon.Carbon` and an `int` as arguments and returns a `carbon.Carbon`.

### Type Assertion:
A type assertion is a way to retrieve the underlying concrete value from an interface type and assign it to a variable of a specific type. In Go, since `interface{}` can hold values of any type, you often need to perform type assertions to work with the underlying value.

In this case, `carbonAdders[word]` holds an `interface{}` value, and we're asserting that this value is of type `func(carbon.Carbon, int) carbon.Carbon`. If the assertion succeeds, the retrieved function can be called with the provided arguments.

If the underlying value isn't of the asserted type, a runtime panic will occur. So, it's essential to ensure that the value stored in the interface matches the asserted type before performing a type assertion.

Overall, item 2 helps us select the appropriate function from the array based on the index, and item 3 ensures that the selected function matches the expected function signature before we call it.
